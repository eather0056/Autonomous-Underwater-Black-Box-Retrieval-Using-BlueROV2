### 1. **Target Identification and Characterization**
   - **Objective**: Develop algorithms to identify and characterize the black box in underwater conditions.
   - **Approach**:
     - Use **computer vision algorithms** and **machine learning models** trained on underwater datasets to recognize the shape and color patterns typical of the black box.
     - Implement **filtering techniques** (e.g., color thresholding and edge detection) to enhance visibility in low-light or murky water conditions.
     - Integrate **depth and distance sensors** (e.g., sonar or LIDAR) to obtain spatial information and refine visual detection accuracy.

### 2. **Object Tracking and Localization**
   - **Objective**: Continuously track the black box once identified and estimate its position relative to the BlueROV2.
   - **Approach**:
     - Use a **monocular or stereo camera system** combined with **image processing techniques** to calculate the relative position of the black box.
     - Incorporate a **Kalman filter** to fuse data from different sensors (visual and sonar) for accurate tracking and to predict the target's location even when visual contact is momentarily lost.
     - Utilize **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)** to map the environment and track the target’s movement within this map.

### 3. **Navigation and Path Planning (M-1 & M-2 as per the document)**
   - **Objective**: Develop autonomous navigation and approach strategies to move the BlueROV2 towards the black box.
   - **Approach**:
     - Implement a **waypoint-based navigation system** using the data from the visual and sonar sensors to guide the ROV from its start location (point 1) to the target area (point 2).
     - Use **path planning algorithms** (e.g., A* or Dijkstra's algorithm) for obstacle avoidance and optimized trajectory planning in complex underwater environments.

### 4. **Close Proximity Maneuvering and Approach (M-3)**
   - **Objective**: Fine-tune the approach to the target for precise grasping.
   - **Approach**:
     - Switch to a **visually-guided control system** when the ROV is close to the target. Implement **visual servoing techniques** that adjust the ROV’s movement based on the target’s position in the camera feed.
     - Use **motion estimation algorithms** (optical flow) to assess the black box’s motion and compensate for underwater currents or disturbances.

### 5. **Grasp Planning and Control**
   - **Objective**: Execute the grasping maneuver using the Newton Subsea Gripper.
   - **Approach**:
     - Develop a **grasp planner** that calculates the optimal approach angle and gripping force based on the black box’s size and orientation.
     - Integrate the **gripper control software** with the perception system to adjust the approach dynamically if the black box moves or if environmental conditions change.
     - Test different **gripping strategies** (e.g., single or dual contact points) using simulations and validate them in real-world underwater trials.

### 6. **Testing and Validation (Simulation and Field Trials)**
   - **Simulation**:
     - Create a simulation environment using tools like **Gazebo** or **ROS** with underwater models for the ROV, the gripper, and the black box.
     - Test the perception algorithms, including target detection, tracking, and navigation strategies, within the simulation before deployment.
   - **Field Trials**:
     - Conduct controlled underwater tests in a pool or safe sea environment to validate the perception system's performance.
     - Fine-tune algorithms based on real-world conditions like lighting variations, water clarity, and dynamic changes in the black box’s position.

### 7. **Integration with Manipulation Software**
   - Ensure seamless integration between the perception system and the manipulation software for a smooth transition from detection to grasping actions.
   - Implement **communication protocols** (e.g., ROS nodes) to synchronize perception data with the gripper’s control system, allowing real-time adjustments based on visual feedback.

### 8. **Final Demonstration and Evaluation**
   - Conduct a full-scale demonstration of the system, covering all stages: detection, approach, grasping, and retrieval (M-1 to M-5 as per the roadmap in the document).
   - Evaluate the system’s performance using metrics such as detection accuracy, approach time, grasp success rate, and recovery efficiency.

This roadmap aligns with the stages outlined in the provided document (e.g., target identification, approach, grasping, and transport). Implementing these steps methodically will ensure a robust perception system capable of autonomously searching for and grasping the black box with the BlueROV2.
